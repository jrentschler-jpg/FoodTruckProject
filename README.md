## OVERVIEW
On Week2 of our Weekend Homework Project, were to build a Food Truck Rating App. From this Food Truck Rating App our users would be able to input the name of (5) Food Trucks, the type of food they offered, and be able to rate the food trucks! From there, the app will take the average of the highest rated food truck and display that food truck's information.

## HOW TO RUN "FOOD TRUCK APP"
1. The app welcomes the user with a nice greeting message. It then displays a menu of instructions which will prompt the user to input the food truck information: name, type, and the rating they will choose for the five food trucks. The unique Truck ID will be incremented by 1 and static so that each food truck will have its on truck ID that the user will not be inputing.
2. If the user shall want to quit on the food truck name, the input will end and the program will continue on.
3. After input, they will see another selection menu for them to choose from the following: list of all food trucks, average rating, highest rated food truck or quit.
4. They can then keep selecting from the menu until they choose to quit. It will keep displaying the menu based on their selections. Once they choose quit it will be blank.
